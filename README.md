# Crop and Weather Dependent Yield ‚Äî Soybeans, Wheat, and Corn

This analysis was completed as part of my **data analysis portfolio** to demonstrate the use of **Excel and Power BI** for extracting insights from agricultural data.

The project explores how **weather and environmental factors**‚Äîparticularly wind speed, rainfall, temperature, and water percentage‚Äîaffect the **yield performance** of three key crops: **wheat, corn, and soybeans**.
The analysis focuses on identifying patterns, comparing yields, and recommending strategies to enhance productivity.

---

##  Objectives

* Identify key environmental factors influencing crop yields.
* Compare yield performance across **wheat**, **corn**, and **soybeans**.
* Recommend strategies for maximizing productivity under varying weather conditions.

---

## üß™ Methodology

### üîπ Data Preparation

* Imported and organized raw crop and weather data in **Excel**.
* Cleaned the dataset by removing inconsistencies and formatting errors.
* Focused on key variables: **wind speed**, **rainfall**, **temperature**, and **% water content**.

### üîπ Analysis and Visualization

* Used **Excel** for data analysis, including descriptive summaries and trend comparisons.
* Created **interactive dashboards in Power BI** to visualize crop performance and environmental relationships.
* Compared crop yields under varying weather and wind conditions to identify influencing factors.

##  Crop-Specific Insights





### **Wheat**

**Key Metrics:**

* Avg. Wind Speed: 3.72 m/s
* Max % Water: 40.2 %
* Total Grain Yield: 316.85 K kg/ha

**Insights:**

* Yield peaks around **8.0 K kg/ha** under higher % H‚ÇÇO.
* **Rainfall > 5.3 mm/day** and **Wind > 5.79 m/s** increase the likelihood of **spring wheat**.



### **Corn**

**Key Metrics:**

* Avg. Wind Speed: 3.72 m/s
* Max % Water: 94.8 %
* Total Grain Yield: 353.30 K kg/ha

**Insights:**

* Highest yield observed at **11.0 K kg/ha** under high % H‚ÇÇO conditions.
* Performs best when **Min Temperature ‚â§ 19.5 ¬∞C** and **Wind ‚â§ 1.48 m/s**.
* Yield variation across treatments ranges between **210 K** and **144 K kg/ha**.

---

### **Soybeans**

**Key Metrics:**

* Avg. Wind Speed: 3.72 m/s
* Max % Water: 14.5 %
* Total Grain Yield: 100.38 K kg/ha

**Insights:**

* Yield peaks at **9.2 K kg/ha** under optimal water conditions.
* Grows best when **Min Temperature > 17.9 ¬∞C**.
* **Wind speeds between 1.67‚Äì5.93 m/s** positively influence growth.

---

##  Comparative Insights

* **Corn** shows the highest total yield (**353.30 K kg/ha**).
* **Soybeans** record the lowest yield (**100.38 K kg/ha**).
* **Wheat** yields are most influenced by **rainfall and wind**.
* **Corn** is influenced mainly by **temperature and wind**.
* **Soybeans** perform best under **warmer conditions with moderate wind**.

---

##  Recommendations

* **Optimize irrigation** for corn to sustain high yields.
* **Manage windbreaks** to protect wheat during high-wind seasons.
* **Plant soybeans** in **warmer areas** with moderate wind exposure.
* **Tailor crop treatment strategies** for each crop type to improve outcomes.

 üìÅ Deliverables

* **Excel workbook** containing data cleaning and analysis.
* **Power BI dashboard** visualizing crop yields and weather influence.
* **Documentation** summarizing findings, insights, and recommendations.
